Feature: GET /Tokens/{id}

User requests a Token

	Scenario Outline: Requesting a Token in a variety of scenarios
		Given Identities <givenIdentities>
		And Token t created by <tokenOwner> with password "<password>" and forIdentity <forIdentity>
		When <activeIdentity> sends a GET request to the /Tokens/t.Id endpoint with password "<passwordOnGet>"
		Then the response status code is <responseStatusCode>

		Examples:
			| givenIdentities | tokenOwner | forIdentity | password | activeIdentity | passwordOnGet | responseStatusCode | description                                                       |
